Fifteen years later, these figures had jumped to 33 agglomerations and a level of urbanisation of 20.9%. This sudden spike in numbers, however, has less to do with population growth than with the spill-over of agglomerations into rural areas.

This is reflected in the quasi absence of very small agglomerations between 10 000 and 20 000 inhabitants in 2015.\\nThe capital Kigali holds slightly more than one-third of the urban population. It is twice as large as the second biggest agglomeration Gisenyi but its dominance has reduced massively since 2000 when Kigali was almost 15 times larger than the second biggest agglomeration. Medium-sized agglomerations account for another third whereas smaller agglomerations account for only 8% of the total urban population.\\nThe urban network itself is strongly interconnected. From the capital Kigali, located at the centre of the country, a web of agglomerations extends practically all the way to Uganda and Congo in the north and towards Burundi in the south.\"\n  }]\n}, {\n  \"id\": 36,\n  \"title\": \"Sudan\",\n  \"map\": {\n    \"geo\": {\n      \"fitBounds\": {\n        \"bound\": [[[21.841485463881099, 8.68549116542911], [38.5796857766238, 22.226578019072377]]]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"keyFigures\": [{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Total population\",\n    \"value\": 38435252\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban population\",\n    \"value\": 16335246\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\",\n    \"value\": 0.43\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 4,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\",\n    \"value\": 301\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\",\n    \"value\": 0.33\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 6,\n    \"type\": \"distance\",\n    \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\",\n    \"value\": 25.10\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 7,\n    \"type\": \"areaPer\",\n    \"title\": \"Average urban density\",\n    \"value\": 4917.34\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 8,\n    \"type\": \"area\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban area\",\n    \"value\": 3321.97\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 9,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\",\n    \"value\": 0.002\n  }],\n  \"data\": {\n    \"totalPop\": [6.68365, 7.901090909, 11.31154, 14.21785714, 18.05280333, 24.62199167, 33.04767, 38.162512],\n    \"urbanPop\": [0.534692, 0.86912, 1.696731, 2.98575, 5.415841, 8.863917, 13.219068, 16.335246],\n    \"ruralPop\": [6.148958, 7.031970909, 9.614809, 11.23210714, 12.63696233, 15.75807467, 19.828602, 21.827266],\n    \"totalPopGrowth\": [0.016874451, 0.036533798, 0.023130994, 0.024167642, 0.031520475, 0.02986848, 0.029198683],\n    \"urbanPopGrowth\": [0.049778335, 0.069186152, 0.058142224, 0.061356408, 0.050499808, 0.040776591, 0.043241773],\n    \"ruralPopGrowth\": [0.01350887, 0.031778228, 0.015668674, 0.011854681, 0.022318091, 0.023243264, 0.019392535]\n  },\n  \"list\": [{\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"item\": \"Sudan is the third largest country in Africa after Algeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It has the fifth lowest level of urbanisation in Africa despite a strong increase in the past two decades which has seen the level of urbanisation grow from 12% in 2000 to the current level of 27%.\\nOfficial urbanisation and population data for South Sudan is, however, not very reliable. Civil unrest has caused significant population movements in recent years. Between 2012 and 2015, ten urban agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants were either totally or partially demolished. Several urban agglomerations that were refugee camps have either moved or disappeared.\\nAfricapolis has counted 66 more urban agglomerations than are officially recognised. Several of these are composed of dwellings and buildings made of organic materials, with very little infrastructure constructed from hard materials and a quasi-absence of roads. As these non-permanent structures are not officially recognised,  national statistics underestimate the true extent of urbanisation in South Sudan.\"\n  }]\n}, {\n  \"id\": 41,\n  \"title\": \"Sao Tome and Principe\",\n  \"map\": {\n    \"geo\": {\n      \"fitBounds\": {\n        \"bound\": [[[6.471150911132696, 0.027995333650139], [7.46542771137786, 1.70347746501912]]]\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"keyFigures\": [{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Total population\",\n    \"value\": 199000\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban population\",\n    \"value\": 160051\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\",\n    \"value\": 0.80\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 4,\n    \"type\": \"number\",\n    \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\",\n    \"value\": 3\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 5,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\",\n    \"value\": 0.84\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 6,\n    \"type\": \"distance\",\n    \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\",\n    \"value\": 11.60\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 7,\n    \"type\": \"areaPer\",\n    \"title\": \"Average urban density\",\n    \"value\": 3710.04\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 8,\n    \"type\": \"area\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban area\",\n    \"value\": 43.14\n  }, {\n    \"id\": 9,\n    \"type\": \"percentage\",\n    \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\",\n    \"value\": 0.045\n  }],\n  \"data\": {\n    \"totalPop\": [0.059841176, 0.162471429, 0.073752381, 0.093242308, 0.115662069, 0.135803333, 0.178794595, 0.200064],\n    \"urbanPop\": [0.010173, 0.011373, 0.030976, 0.048486, 0.067084, 0.081482, 0.132308, 0.160051],\n    \"ruralPop\": [0.049668176, 0.151098429, 0.042776381, 0.044756308, 0.048578069, 0.054321333, 0.046486595, 0.040013],\n    \"totalPopGrowth\": [0.105039208, -0.075940567, 0.023725914, 0.021780933, 0.016183052, 0.027884685, 0.022734515],\n    \"urbanPopGrowth\": [0.011212896, 0.105388723, 0.0458252, 0.032999852, 0.019633916, 0.049669172, 0.038806019],\n    \"ruralPopGrowth\": [0.117681785, -0.118556643, 0.00453488, 0.008227641, 0.011237153, -0.015454637, -0.029546622]\n  },\n  \"list\": [{\n    \"type\": \"text\",\n    \"item\": \"Sao Tomé-et-Principe ranks amongst the smallest African nations and is the smallest nation by population and surface area within the countries included in the Africapolis database.

compared to less than half (30.5%) in 1990. Yet, the capital Luanda alone counts for almost half (44%)  of the total urban population and dominates the urban landscape. Angola's capital is almost 12 times as large as the second biggest city Lubango, resulting  in the third highest primacy score in all of Africa. The rapid growth of Luanda is in part due to the devastating civil war that ravaged the interior of the country from 1975 to 1992 and has made Luanda a refuge for many Angolans.\\nDespite only having 25 million inhabitants in total, Angola counts six agglomerations with more than 500 000 inhabitants, including the capital. These are: Luanda, Lubango, Huambo, Cabinda, Benguela and Lobito.  The latter two are separated by less than 30 kilometres  and are expected to merge into one big urban agglomeration/region in the next few years, bringing their total population to 1.6 million. The urban population density level is one of the highest in Africa at an average of 6 767 inhabitants per km2. There are 7 233 inhabitants per km2 in Luanda but some cities such as Saurimo count more than 10 000 inhabitants per km2.\\nThere are also 31 agglomerations with populations between 50 000 and 500 000 but very few smaller agglomerations with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants. Only 5.3% of Angolans live in smaller urban agglomerations. Given the size of the country, it is noticeable that the territory is only weakly inter-linked by urban agglomerations.

This would give the country a level of urbanisation of just 10% compared to 20% according to the findings of Africapolis, which uses the built environment as a key indicator of urbanisation. Nonetheless, Burundi remains one of the least urbanised countries in the world.\\nThe first urban agglomeration with more than 10 000 inhabitants only emerged in the 1940s. Until 2000, Burundi had the lowest level of urbanisation in the world alongside Bhutan and Rwanda. At the time, the country only counted six urban agglomerations with more than 10 000 inhabitants and a level of urbanisation of just 6.9%. Fifteen years later, these figures had jumped to 33 agglomerations and a level of urbanisation of 20.9%. This sudden spike in numbers, however, has less to do with population growth than with the spill-over of agglomerations into rural areas. Nonetheless, Burundi retains a distinctly non-urban character partially due to the topography of the country, which is dominated by numerous undulating hills creating a sprawling but interspersed periphery.\\nBurundi's primacy score is the fourth highest in Africa. The capital Bujumbura, which counted a population of just over one million in 2015, represents the largest agglomeration by far. The remaining 32 urban agglomerations have populations of fewer than 100 000. The relatively small size of the country however means that overall population density is quite high at 353 inhabitants per km2 (the second highest in Africa) and most of the urban agglomerations are dotted along the country's territory in a fairly dense network.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":3,\r\n    \"title\":\"Benin\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 0.774558544224476,6.22447495853009],[3.85082880284835, 12.393508622871479 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 10749468  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 5272274  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.49  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 122  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.41  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  14.20  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 4325.01  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 1219.02  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.01  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[1.58,2.293,2.654628571,3.498704167,4.771203571,6.469733333,8.9218325,10.791847]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.079,0.2293,0.371648,0.839689,1.335937,2.135012,3.568733,5.272274]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[1.501,2.0637,2.282980571,2.659015167,3.435266571,4.334721333,5.3530995,5.519573]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.03794585,0.014752129,0.027993446,0.031506746,0.030922085,0.032658605,0.038791394]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.112442818,0.049476636,0.084922376,0.04753068,0.048000366,0.052716363,0.081176962]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.032349109,0.010149295,0.01536423,0.025944725,0.023528816,0.02132606,0.006143749]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"In 2015, almost half of the population of Benin lived in an urban agglomeration. Between 2000 and 2015, the country saw a rapid increase in the total urban population, which went from 2.1 million to 5.1 million. Over the same period, the number of agglomerations increased from 41 to 111, resulting from the rise of smaller agglomerations with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants.\\nThe two largest urban agglomerations, Cotonou and Porto Novo, account for almost one-fifth of the total population of the country. Both agglomerations are separated by only a few hundred metres of undeveloped land and are likely to merge into a bigger conurbation in a few years. By adding the multiple smaller and medium-sized agglomerations that are located around the Cotonou-Porto Novo agglomerations, a large metropolitan area emerges that holds almost half of the total population but only covers 10% of the surface area of Benin. The relative concentration of urban agglomerations in the country's south is also reflected in the average distance between agglomerations, which is only 7.4 km in the metropolitan area but 22.6 km in the more sparsely populated north.\\nThe only other larger agglomerations are Parakou in the north and Abomey-Bohicon.

Although Ouagadougou counted a population of 2.3 million in 2015 against 668 000 for Bobo-Dioulasso, the former capital still represents an important part of the urban population and is six times larger than the third biggest agglomeration Koudougou (pop. 111 000).\\nAn interesting characteristic of Burkina Faso's primary urban agglomerations is their location along the historic railroad connecting Abidjan (Ivory Coast) to Ouagadougou. The four biggest cities of the country are all located along this stretch.

In 2015, it reached an urbanisation level of 37% with the capital Bangui acting as the largest agglomeration, accounting for half of the total urban population of the country. However, outside of the capital the urbanisation level barely reaches 21%. Conflict, political instability and economic uncertainty have created numerous set-backs over the past decades in terms of urban development, with internal displacement contributing to the de-urbanisation of some areas.\\nThe dominance of the capital is uncontested and reflected in its size: it is 10 times larger than the second biggest agglomeration Berberati and had a population just short of 1 million. If one adds to this the 7th arrondissement of Bangui, the capital exceeded the 1 million mark in 2015. However, unlike the official statistics, Africapolis considers the 7th arrondissement a separate agglomeration as it is not yet properly linked up to the rest of the capital.\\nA characteristic of urbanisation in the Central African Republic is the relative absence of small and medium sized agglomerations for a country of its size. There are fewer than 30 small agglomerations (10 000 ??50 000 inhabitants) and fewer than 5 medium sized agglomerations (50 000 ??500 000), leading to a relatively poorly established urban network across the territory.

Most smaller agglomerations seem to have sprung up along the network of improvised dirt tracks that pervade the country's territory.

Some of the smaller urban agglomerations such as Dikhil, Tadjoura and Obock have densities that are even higher (more than 11 000 inhabitants per km2) and are growing at a rapid rate thanks to their strategic location along the axis connecting Djibouti to Addis Ababa.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":13,\r\n    \"title\":\"Algeria\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -8.673969078782633,18.9635345895493],[11.9809701071419, 37.09150628917579 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 39963000  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 26303432  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.66  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 475  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.15  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  18.50  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3744.18  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 7025.15  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.003  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[8.945370588,10.25710667,13.44442059,17.75260769,24.79492955,30.51010189,36.1805871,39.74736397]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[1.520713,3.077132,4.571103,6.923517,10.909769,16.170354,22.431964,26.303434]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[7.424657588,7.179974667,8.873317588,10.82909069,13.88516055,14.33974789,13.7486231,13.44392997]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.013777512,0.027428768,0.028186759,0.033975081,0.020958473,0.017192607,0.018982075]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.073025114,0.040369204,0.042390814,0.046523245,0.040136645,0.033272277,0.032354916]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[-0.003345463,0.021401077,0.020118436,0.025170006,0.003226652,-0.004200809,-0.004472166]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Algeria is the most developed country in Africa in terms of its human development index rating and has the eighth highest level of urbanisation in Africa at 65.8%.

Given the large number of agglomerations just under the 10 000-inhabitant threshold, it is expected that the number of urban agglomerations will grow strongly over the next few years.\\nThe capital Algiers is almost four times larger than the second biggest agglomeration, Oran. Nonetheless, the weight of the capital is relatively modest compared to other African nations of comparable size.

Larger urban agglomerations above 500혻000 (of which there are only two, Algiers and Oran) only represent one- fifth of the total urban population.\\nUrbanisation in Algeria has progressed gradually. Whilst the country was one of the least urbanised of North Africa in the mid-19th century, the emergence of smaller urban agglomerations took off after independence when greater priority was given to the industrialisation of the country. Over time, many of these newer urban agglomerations have shifted south, away from the coast, where they compete with the most cultivable lands. The proportion of coastal urban agglomerations has in fact reduced dramatically since independence, dropping from 24% to just 6% in 2015.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":14,\r\n    \"title\":\"Egypt\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 24.697996257418708,22.0013421472637],[35.7615737570691, 31.664110210683646 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 90626816  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 84375765  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.93  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 1061  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.27  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  5.40  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 12281.88  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 6869.94  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.007  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[20.68056341,25.95026809,32.37336981,40.34730984,52.17558116,63.52310676,79.63258605,90.726629]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[8.479031,12.196626,17.157886,24.611859,36.001151,47.007099,68.484024,84.375765]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[12.20153241,13.75364209,15.21548381,15.73545084,16.17443016,16.51600776,11.14856205,6.350864]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.022958342,0.022361781,0.02226306,0.026042313,0.01987382,0.022859325,0.02642871]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.037025292,0.03471896,0.036735725,0.038764734,0.027033729,0.038347166,0.042619133]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.01204619,0.010152179,0.003365912,0.002755332,0.002092032,-0.038539653,-0.106441909]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Egypt is Africa's second most populous nation after Nigeria.

Some urban agglomerations such as Port Said, Faiyum and Tanta even surpass an average of 20 000 inhabitants per square kilometre. Demographic growth remains high with 2.4 million people being added each year, leading to a staggering increase of 40 inhabitants per square kilometre on average.

The second and third largest agglomerations, Sodo Town and Hawassa City ??both located in foothills - do not have an urban centre but are examples of in-situ urbanisation that has resulted from the fusion of smaller but densely populated towns and villages. These two agglomerations alone account for one-sixth of the total urban population.\\nOne-third of the agglomerations in Ethiopia have emerged through in-situ urbanisation. They challenge the very notion of urban agglomeration as in many cases, they retain a largely rural and agricultural character. If the current demographic trends persist - especially with regards to a fertility rate of more than five children per woman  in rural areas - it is expected that Ethiopia will see the emergence of many more agglomerations of the same type.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":17,\r\n    \"title\":\"Gabon\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 8.695935814827443,-3.97664306377109],[14.5024185687666, 2.324250541417371 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 1866481  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 1506156  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.81  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 14  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.59  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  95.40  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 4211.73  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 357.61  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.001  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[0.346666667,0.459,0.5115,0.77934,0.929747273,1.335029231,1.705620548,1.859452]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.0104,0.0459,0.1023,0.233802,0.511361,0.867769,1.245103,1.506156]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[0.336266667,0.4131,0.4092,0.545538,0.418386273,0.467260231,0.460517548,0.353296]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.028466287,0.010888591,0.043009185,0.017803159,0.036842012,0.024800113,0.017420562]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.160053275,0.083443566,0.086168638,0.081403916,0.054308366,0.036764492,0.038802378]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.020791718,-0.000948116,0.029174313,-0.026187731,0.01110938,-0.001452482,-0.051628471]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"With an urbanisation level of 80.7%, Gabon ranks as the African nation with the second highest level of urbanisation (alongside Libya).

Libreville itself holds almost 60% of the total urban population of the country.

Libreville is now six times larger than Port-Gentil and expected to reach 1 million inhabitants ??equal to half the population of the country ??by 2020.\\nGabon's urbanization profile stands out amongst other African nations due to the relative absence of small agglomerations. Contrary to other African nations that have seen a large increase in the number of smaller agglomerations in recent decades, there are very few agglomerations with populations between 10 000 and 100 000 in Gabon. This deficit is reflected in the relatively weak interlinkages between urban agglomerations across the territory, where the average distance between agglomerations stands at 70km ??a relatively large distance by African standards.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":18,\r\n    \"title\":\"Ghana\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -3.257547122710676,4.73578730703557],[1.19206530262996, 11.173995950817698 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 27403036  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 14236199  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.52  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 209  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.51  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  17.40  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3900.65  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 3649.70  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.016  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[5.1097375,6.620929412,8.280684,11.14068846,14.17388667,18.1193641,24.21871837,27.377306]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.408779,1.125558,2.070171,2.896579,4.252166,7.066552,11.867172,14.236199]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[4.7009585,5.495371412,6.210513,8.244109462,9.921720667,11.0528121,12.35154637,13.141107]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.026247322,0.022621044,0.030112321,0.024371985,0.024862021,0.029439482,0.024820751]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.106593029,0.062830072,0.034160428,0.039136221,0.052106575,0.05320756,0.037073084]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.01573651,0.012308871,0.028730527,0.018695352,0.010854338,0.011171579,0.012469907]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"In 2015, 52% of Ghana's population lived in urban agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants.

Although the country counts 11 urban agglomerations in total, 4 of the largest (Serrakunda, Brikama, Tanjeh and Banjul) are located on the country's coastline and are separated only by a few hundred metres of unconstructed land. These agglomerations are expected to form one big conurbation as their densities increase, most likely reducing the total number of urban agglomerations in the country. Only three urban agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants are located in the country's interior where the level of urbanisation barely exceeds 10%.\\nGambia's biggest urban agglomeration is Serrekunda to the south of the capital Banjul. It counts 789혻000 inhabitants and is seven times larger than the second biggest agglomeration Brikama. Serrekunda alone accounts for 70% of the country's urban population. By contrast, Banjul's population has been in decline since the 1980s due to the limited size of the territory on which Banjul is built but also due to the emergence of newer urban agglomerations along the stretch of land that connects Banjul to the rest of the country.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":21,\r\n    \"title\":\"Guinea-Bissau\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -16.716210858836821,10.9267692162175],[-13.6344428845149, 12.684674465103612 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 1530637  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 525458  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.34  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 6  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.78  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  40.40  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 4968.40  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 105.76  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.004  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[0.512922222,0.553822222,0.49405,0.808725,0.958222727,1.178542857,1.51726129,1.545465]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.046163,0.049844,0.118572,0.129396,0.210809,0.329992,0.470351,0.525458]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[0.466759222,0.503978222,0.375478,0.679329,0.747413727,0.848550857,1.04691029,1.020007]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.007701456,-0.011355732,0.050516786,0.017106805,0.020911019,0.025584621,0.003690375]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.007701456,0.090528264,0.008773978,0.050018207,0.045830797,0.036076602,0.022405524]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.007701456,-0.029004376,0.061083511,0.009597093,0.012771988,0.021229047,-0.005193219]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Guinea-Bissau is the least populous country of continental West Africa.

In fact, the urbanisation level has seen a drastic increase in the five years since 2010 when it stood at just 46.5%. This increase is partly due to the emergence of smaller agglomerations, of which there was only 1 in 2000, but whose numbers are expected to grow to 17 by 2020. However, given the relative concentration of the urban population and the limitations of the territory, the emergence of newer agglomerations is expected to be quite limited in the future.\\nIn addition, Equatorial Guinea has one of the highest rates of demographic growth in sub-Saharan Africa as its natural and mineral wealth has attracted migrants from outside the country. Between 1990 and 2000, the urban population grew at an annual rate of 15.2% compared to an overall annual population increase of just 9.5% across the country. This population increase has also contributed to the rapid increase in urbanization.\\nThe country is divided into two parts: the island of Bioko - off the coast of Cameroon - which is the location of the capital Malabo, and the mainland, which is situated 200 kilometres away from the island. The urban population is spread across just 13 urban agglomerations, the largest being Bata on the mainland.

The southern part of the country is only sparsely populated and the road infrastructure connecting various localities is very poorly developed.\\nUnlike many other African countries, Liberia has experienced very little growth in the number of urban agglomerations. Between 1980 and 2000, the number of urban agglomerations remained stable at 14 but increased to 24 by 2010. In 2015, the number stood at 21 urban agglomerations. This decline is due to the disappearance in 2012 of three refugee camps that counted more than 10 000 inhabitants. The appearance and disappearance of urban agglomerations is also linked to mining activities that have given rise to new settlements but also triggered their dissipation once mining operations closed.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":25,\r\n    \"title\":\"Libya\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 9.388093959395881,19.5073822641284],[25.148468001036, 33.169291009271674 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 5467108  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 4410900  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.81  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 46  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.44  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  63.20  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 1427.84  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 3089.22  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.002  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[0.943490769,1.35917,2.022957143,3.066045313,4.290715789,5.311245,5.445554321,5.445552624]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.613269,0.815502,1.132856,1.962269,3.260944,4.248996,4.410899,4.410899]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[0.330221769,0.543668,0.890101143,1.103776313,1.029771789,1.062249,1.034655321,1.034653624]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.037178755,0.040569974,0.042459493,0.034177579,0.021566537,0.002500449,-6.23185E-08]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.028910032,0.033415492,0.056472954,0.052103535,0.02681995,0.003746581,0]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.051121228,0.050535079,0.021748882,-0.006915984,0.00310994,-0.00262854,-3.27992E-07]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Libya has been going through a period of upheaval since the civil war of 2011 and has seen its population decline due to war casualties and populations displacements. The exact population figures are hard to determine. Whilst Africapolis was able to verify the location of residential structures, it is not clear whether these are necessarily inhabited. As a result, the official population figure for 2015 has remained the same as that retained during the last update.\\nDespite these uncertainties, Libya is the country with the second highest level of urbanisation in Africa at 80.4% (on par with Gabon). Libya is the fourth largest African country by surface area but despite its size, it only counts 46 urban agglomerations. The largest is the capital Tripoli with almost 2 million inhabitants, spread out on a surface area of 1 745 square kilometres which makes it one of the vastest urban agglomerations on the African continent. Like Tripoli, most of Libya's largest agglomerations are characterised by a relatively weak urban population density. The average urban population density stood at just 1 428 inhabitants per km2 in 2015, the third lowest in Africa after Swaziland and Kenya.\\nLibya counts only two cities above 500 000 inhabitants: Tripoli and Benghazi. They account for 58% of all urban dwellers. By contrast, smaller agglomerations only account for 15% of the total urban population and their numbers have been stagnating since 2000.

At the same time, the country has seen significant population growth (from 8.2 to 15.2 million) which has also translated into a larger urban population (from 1.5 to 5.7 million).\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":29,\r\n    \"title\":\"Mozambique\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 30.218810884823739,-26.8673412758106],[40.8374143565547, -10.475241344327628 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 26961267  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 8926738  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.34  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 167  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.30  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  28.80  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3132.64  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 2849.59  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.004  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[6.79325,6.575,8.436085714,11.56215714,13.31643333,16.44656552,21.49151515,26.582876]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.135865,0.263,0.590526,1.618702,2.396958,4.769504,7.0922,8.926738]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[6.657385,6.312,7.845559714,9.943455143,10.91947533,11.67706152,14.39931515,17.656138]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[-0.003260163,0.025237594,0.032023979,0.014226387,0.021336211,0.02711526,0.043438811]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.068279306,0.084247246,0.106095914,0.040038346,0.07122643,0.040472906,0.047086024]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[-0.005313253,0.021987759,0.02397968,0.009407309,0.006730392,0.021176535,0.041623515]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Mozambique officially counts 88 cities of which 77 have a population of more than 10 000 inhabitants. However, Africapolis data shows that there are as many as 157 separate urban agglomerations. The biggest agglomeration is the capital Maputo which counts 2.6 million inhabitants. In addition to Maputo, there are four more agglomerations that count more than 300 000 inhabitants (Beira, Nampula, Chimoio and Quelimane). Many of the smaller agglomerations that have emerged recently are located further inland.\\nUntil the 1970s, Mozambique remained largely rural with a level of urbanisation below 10% and a total of just six urban agglomerations within its territory. By 1990, that figure had increased to 17.6% and 15 urban agglomerations in total. Urbanisation however took off after 1990 when the country experienced a tripling of the number of urban agglomerations within just 10 years to 65 in 2000 and then another increase in recent years to bring the total number to 157. This growth is largely driven by the rapid increase in smaller agglomerations between 10 000 and 50 000 inhabitants.\\nMozambique's urban agglomerations are relatively evenly distributed across the territory. Despite the relatively small number of agglomerations for a country of Mozambique's size, the average distance between agglomerations is quite low (38km in 2010). Amongst the newer agglomerations, two different kinds can be distinguished: large circular towns with low densities and hyper-linear towns that emerge around the road networks. These agglomerations are often characterised by a lack of infrastructure and the predominance of agricultural activities and roadside businesses. Many of these agglomerations also display low levels of density (3 138 inhabitants per km2 on average in 2015).\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":30,\r\n    \"title\":\"Mauritania\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -17.067787646818925,14.7171671732258],[-4.82863658274659, 27.296920902860109 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 4034103  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 1713049  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.42  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 23  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.69  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  106.50  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 4407.69  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 388.65  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.000  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[0,0,1.160728571,1.458028571,1.977825,2.533648485,3.24814878,4.078688]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0,0,0.081251,0.306186,0.712017,0.836104,1.331741,1.713049]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[0,0,1.079477571,1.151842571,1.265808,1.697544485,1.91640778,2.365639]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0,0,0.023065727,0.030960872,0.025075491,0.025153633,0.046590804]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0,0,0.141867367,0.088054134,0.01619486,0.047649348,0.051647038]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0,0,0.006509667,0.009479424,0.029782086,0.0122008,0.043018734]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Mauritania is the third largest West African country by surface area (behind Mali and Niger) and has the second lowest population density in Africa behind Namibia and Libya at just 4 inhabitants per km2 (on par with Botswana).

Until 25 years ago, Malawi was largely rural with a level of urbanisation of just 10% in 1990.

Most of the other larger urban agglomerations such as Rundu, Walvis Bay, Oshakati and Swakopmund are situated on the country's borders which magnify the relative ?쐃mptiness??of the interior parts of the country. The overall level of urbanisation stands at 40% but the population density in the urban agglomerations is the seventh lowest in Africa at 2 804 inhabitants per km2.\\nContrary to most African nations, there are few agglomerations below 20 000 inhabitants and 13 out of the 17 cities have populations between 20 000 and 40 000. Whilst the distance between urban agglomerations has gradually decreased as more cities emerge and existing cities grow, the average distance between cities remains very high by African standards at 107 kilometres.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":33,\r\n    \"title\":\"Niger\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 0.164802208197493,11.6958527626051],[15.9966039359589, 23.523016092945412 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 18850739  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 3270216  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.17  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 68  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.33  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  37.70  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 5946.50  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 549.94  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.000  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[2.33,2.808266667,4.31076,5.768477778,7.798678571,10.65823125,15.6550125,19.236565]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.0233,0.084248,0.215538,0.519163,1.091815,1.705317,2.504802,3.270216]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[2.3067,2.724018667,4.095222,5.249314778,6.706863571,8.95291425,13.1502105,15.966349]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.018845291,0.043786198,0.029557811,0.030613862,0.031730838,0.039194472,0.042065028]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.13715684,0.098490802,0.091887737,0.077170702,0.045600077,0.039194472,0.054776894]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.016768063,0.041613829,0.025138435,0.024806062,0.029305978,0.039194472,0.039572022]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Niger has the lowest level of urbanisation in Africa at just 17.3%. Unlike many other African countries, its level of urbanisation has not increased much since 1990 when it stood at 14%. However, the total number of agglomerations has increased sharply over that period, jumping from 24 to 68 in 2015. This growth has been largely driven by an increase in the number of smaller agglomerations with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants, which accounted for one-third of the urban population in 2015.\\nWith a population of 18.9 million spread out over a relatively vast territory, Niger also has the third lowest population density in West Africa at 16 inhabitants per km2 against an average of 29 for the region. However, 96% of the population lives in the southern half of the country which only represents one- quarter of the surface. Here, densities approach an average of 60 inhabitants per km2. Within the urban agglomerations, this density is as high as 5 947 inhabitants per km2 in 2015. This high urban density is the result of the relative absence of urban sprawl.\\nIn addition to the capital Niamey, there are four more urban agglomerations counting more than 100혻000 inhabitants: Maradi, Zinder, Tahoua and Agadez. Despite Niamey's extraordinary growth (going from 8 300 inhabitants in 1950 to over one  million in 2015), Maradi and Zinder are gradually transforming into strategically important cities rivaling the capital due to their location at the Nigerian border.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":34,\r\n    \"title\":\"Nigeria\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 2.669757522728581,4.27986046567154],[14.6781749992943, 13.893191705761652 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 186939800  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 98950505  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.53  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 1236  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.21  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  13.60  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 5023.29  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 19698.35  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.022  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[32.96276364,40.05989048,49.7456,65.15935484,86.07026316,115.7335714,160.205,188.038562]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[3.625904,8.412577,12.4364,20.1994,32.7067,48.6081,76.8984,98.950505]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[29.33685964,31.64731348,37.3092,44.95995484,53.36356316,67.12547143,83.3066,89.088057]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.019691066,0.021890805,0.027358954,0.028223761,0.030055493,0.033050783,0.032557323]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.087805562,0.039864047,0.049698022,0.049372855,0.040416406,0.046937765,0.051720023]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.00760966,0.016594858,0.018828284,0.017283254,0.023208768,0.021831311,0.013509947]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"The territory of modern-day Nigeria gave rise to some of Africa's most important pre-colonial cities. By 1890, Nigeria was already home to more than twenty cities with a population of more than 20혻000 inhabitants and by 1911 the country counted more cities with populations above 10 000 than the rest of sub-Saharan Africa combined.\\nToday, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and has the second highest level of urbanisation (52%) in West Africa after Gambia. Its population density is the fourth highest in Africa at 205혻inhabitants per km2. The demographic weight of Nigeria is a key factor in explaining not just the high number of urban agglomerations but also their relatively large size.\\nAccording to Africapolis, Nigeria accommodates 1 158 urban agglomerations, making it the country with the largest number of urban agglomerations in Africa. Unlike the rest of the region, Nigeria is characterised by a large number of medium-sized cities with populations between 50 000 and 500혻000. Many of these are located in the southern part of the country but the sheer number of urban agglomerations overall means that the whole territory represents one extensive urban network.\\nIn 2015, just over half of all urban dwellers lived in agglomerations of more than 500 000 inhabitants. The most populous city (Lagos) accounts for about 12% of the country's urban population. Lagos and Kano (the third largest agglomeration) both score urban density levels above 12 500 inhabitants per km2 compared to a national average of just 4 959. In fact, some of Nigeria's largest urban agglomerations such as Onitsha, Aba and Uyo, are spread out over vast territories.

In fact, Rwanda has one of the highest levels of urbanisation in Africa, largely as a result of the phenomenal densification of rural areas. At 446 inhabitants per km2 nationally, Rwanda has the highest average population density in Africa.\\nUrbanisation has grown spectacularly over the past three decades. The total urban population grew six-fold between 1990 and 2000 to reach 2 million, before tripling again to attain 6.3 million in 2015. Similarly, the level of urbanisation has increased from 5% in 1990, to 26% in 2000 before reaching 56% in 2015. Over the same period, the country has seen a rapid increase in the number of agglomerations which went from just 7 in 1990 to 53 in 2000. In 2015, the number reduced to 41 agglomerations as a result of the fusion of several agglomerations into greater conurbations. This is reflected in the quasi absence of very small agglomerations between 10 000 and 20 000 inhabitants in 2015.\\nThe capital Kigali holds slightly more than one-third of the urban population. It is twice as large as the second biggest agglomeration Gisenyi but its dominance has reduced massively since 2000 when Kigali was almost 15 times larger than the second biggest agglomeration.

The climate ranges from arid deserts in the northern two-thirds of the country to semi-arid in the south and some pockets of tropical savannah in the southern-most regions. The northwestern part of the country is largely uninhabited.\\nIn 1950, Sudan was the most urbanised country in  east Africa (8%). The level of urbanisation remains high and has gone up from 30% in 1990 to 42% in 2015. Over the same period, the number of urban agglomerations has increased  from 78 to 280 agglomerations in 2015, giving it the seventh highest number of urban agglomerations in Africa. The largest growth can be seen in the number of smaller agglomerations with fewer than 100혻000 inhabitants. Whilst there were only 69 such agglomerations in 1990, there were more than 205 in this category in 2015. The politico-administrative framework has not kept pace with these changes: in 2008, only 96 agglomerations with more than 10혻000 inhabitants were formally classified as cities whereas the country counted more than 200 agglomerations of similar size.\\nUrbanisation in Sudan is also characterised by a relatively large urban primacy index, the second highest  in east Africa after Djibouti. The capital Khartoum is almost 10 times as large as the second city Nyala, both in terms of population and built area. The region of Jazira, within which the capital is located, is largely arid except for the delta between the two Nile rivers that have historically provided opportunities for the development of sophisticated irrigation techniques and have thereby contributed to high population growth in an otherwise barren region. This area of 20혻000 square kilometres, representing only 1.1% of Sudan's overall surface area, accounts for 44% of the total urban population of the country.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":37,\r\n    \"title\":\"Senegal\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -17.518238081460641,12.3056304076076],[-11.3437280103967, 16.694767960271577 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 14143151  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 7156859  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.51  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 74  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.55  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  25.00  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 7465.25  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 958.69  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.005  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[2.083333333,2.482945833,3.757378571,5.636397143,7.316504762,9.627752381,12.50626809,14.033057]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.4375,0.595907,1.052066,1.972739,3.072932,4.043656,5.877946,7.156859]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[1.645833333,1.887038833,2.705312571,3.663658143,4.243572762,5.584096381,6.628322085,6.876198]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.017702516,0.04229768,0.041385828,0.026432057,0.027831978,0.02650314,0.023304564]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.031383176,0.058489246,0.064884889,0.045317767,0.027831978,0.038114217,0.040158144]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.013770147,0.036677473,0.030788938,0.014802833,0.027831978,0.01729069,0.007369863]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"In 2015, around half of the population of Senegal lived in urban agglomerations.

The average urban population density is 5 780 inhabitants per km2, the fourth highest in West Africa.\\nThe dominance of Freetown is related to the establishment of the capital at the extreme western end of the country, on the peninsula that formed the former British crown colony of Sierra Leone in 1808 and today corresponds to the Western Area. The interior of the country was only demarcated at the end of the 19th century and remains poorly connected to the capital. Much of the interior's infrastructure was also destroyed during the civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002 and which further catalysed the concentration of the urban population.

This density is explained by the precarious security situation in Somalia which tends to encourage a clustering of populations, as well as the extraordinary household occupation level which is the highest in the world with an average of 10 people per household.\\nIn 2015, the level of urbanization stood at 36%. The capital Mogadishu and Hargeisa (capital of Somaliland) account for more than half of all urban dwellers. By contrast, there are few smaller agglomerations for a country of its size and some of the more recent agglomerations have emerged closer to the Ethiopian border, as opposed to the coastal areas, which have seen the abandonment and decline of some former port cities.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":40,\r\n    \"title\":\"South Sudan\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 24.154191200790834,3.48882867444349],[35.9483682369437, 12.199554327204311 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 12408235  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 3361900  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.27  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 90  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.11  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  31.80  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 2936.23  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 1144.97  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.002  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[1.8,2.224,2.618833333,4.444542857,6.2234875,6.971208333,9.422592,12.451481]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.018,0.04448,0.15713,0.311118,0.497879,0.836545,2.355648,3.3619]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[1.782,2.17952,2.461703333,4.133424857,5.7256085,6.134663333,7.066944,9.089581]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.021377362,0.016476418,0.054318735,0.034238433,0.011410421,0.030590732,0.057328953]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.094685152,0.134512886,0.070697042,0.04814138,0.053262325,0.109078046,0.073729485]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.020340948,0.012249301,0.053191713,0.03312093,0.006924501,0.01424784,0.051628731]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"South Sudan is the newest nation in Africa, formed in 2011 after an independence referendum. It is completely landlocked and borders on several states that are themselves landlocked (Chad, Uganda, Ethiopia). The population density is relatively low at 19 inhabitants per km2 and the urban population density is the eighth lowest in Africa at just 2 893 inhabitants per km2.\\nThe population is unevenly distributed, and some parts of South Sudan are largely uninhabited. Most of the urban agglomerations are located along the Southern border with Uganda and in the marshlands between the western plateau and the White Nile. In 2015, slightly more than one-quarter of the population lived in urban agglomerations. It has the fifth lowest level of urbanisation in Africa despite a strong increase in the past two decades which has seen the level of urbanisation grow from 12% in 2000 to the current level of 27%.\\nOfficial urbanisation and population data for South Sudan is, however, not very reliable. Civil unrest has caused significant population movements in recent years. Between 2012 and 2015, ten urban agglomerations of more than 10 000 inhabitants were either totally or partially demolished. Several urban agglomerations that were refugee camps have either moved or disappeared.\\nAfricapolis has counted 66 more urban agglomerations than are officially recognised. Several of these are composed of dwellings and buildings made of organic materials, with very little infrastructure constructed from hard materials and a quasi-absence of roads.

Most of Chad's urban agglomerations are located along the east-west axis from Lake Chad to the Sudanese border and along the Chari River, flowing southeast from the Lake towards the border with the Central-African Republic.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":44,\r\n    \"title\":\"Togo\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ -0.148311878875006,6.10365306702988],[1.79632392295911, 11.141009656630501 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 6835000  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 3401532  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.50  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 53  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.51  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  17.90  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3513.18  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 968.22  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.018  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[1.05454,1.481754545,1.98691,2.664332,3.467324,4.515010714,6.053306977,6.83249]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.052727,0.162993,0.397382,0.666083,0.866831,1.264203,2.602922,3.401532]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[1.001813,1.318761545,1.589528,1.998249,2.600493,3.250807714,3.450384977,3.430958]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.034597253,0.029769899,0.029771847,0.026693018,0.026754077,0.029753772,0.024512499]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.119472911,0.093210826,0.053008837,0.026693018,0.038456331,0.074891018,0.054976247]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.027869457,0.018849862,0.023147252,0.026693018,0.022571205,0.005976018,-0.001128621]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Togo's urban profile is characterised by the striking dominance of its capital Lome whose size encompasses most of Togo's coastal front. The country has the sixth highest primacy score in Africa. With a population of 1.7 million, the agglomeration of Lome is ten times as large as the second biggest agglomeration Tsevie despite only covering an area three times as large. Slightly more than half of all urban dwellers in the country and one-quarter of the total population reside in the Lome agglomeration.\\nDespite its relatively small surface area, the country counted 54 urban agglomerations in 2015. This represents a doubling of the number of urban agglomerations in just 15 years. Over the same period, the urban population practically tripled from 1 264 000 in 2000 to 3 416 000 in 2015. Some of these newer agglomerations have emerged around secondary cities or through the fusion of multiple villages. This is for instance the case of Kana in the north of Togo, which over time is expected to merge with smaller agglomerations in its vicinity to create a larger conurbation.\\nThe urbanisation process in Togo can be described as somewhat anarchic. It is typified by the continuous encroachment of urban agglomerations into rural areas through the expansion of the built environment. This sprawl derives from inadequate planning laws that encourage spontaneous construction by homebuilders. It poses a challenge not just for the surrounding rural areas but also in terms of the provision of basic social services such as drinking water, electricity or healthcare.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":45,\r\n    \"title\":\"Tunisia\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 7.52585996610344,30.2413525296127],[11.5964283339481, 37.349728455171743 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 11118935  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 7010411  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.63  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 89  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.35  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  20.10  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 2608.72  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 2687.30  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.017  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[3.40376087,4.100284,5.057213793,6.319064865,7.963811111,9.441933333,10.53715965,11.1276371]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.782865,1.025071,1.466592,2.338054,3.583715,4.815386,6.006181,7.010411]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[2.62089587,3.075213,3.590621793,3.981010865,4.380096111,4.626547333,4.530978649,4.117226103]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.018791915,0.021197487,0.022525506,0.023403302,0.017171066,0.011035169,0.010964437]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.02732228,0.036467137,0.047742408,0.043633215,0.029982306,0.022343243,0.031404479]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.016114254,0.015615794,0.010374484,0.00959927,0.00548903,-0.002085115,-0.018969431]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Tunisia is the smallest of the North African countries with a population of just over 11 million.

At 63%, it has one of the highest levels of urbanisation in Africa.\\nTunisia's cities have faced a long history of population decline and rebounds. At the end of the 19th century, most of the larger cities saw their populations decline due to epidemics, malnutrition, political upheaval and crime. However, many cities recovered during the 20th century and the level of urbanisation reached 25% by 1950 and 50% by 1990. Today, Tunisia's coastal agglomerations continue to attract populations from the country's rural interior, which continues to experience a decline of its population.\\nIn 2015, the average urban population density stood at just 2 609 inhabitants per square kilometre, the sixth lowest in Africa. The low urban density is explained by the importance of the tourism sector in Tunisia which results in large stretches of land being occupied by hotels and other tourism-related infrastructure. Most of the urban agglomerations are located in the North and East of the country along the coastline.\\nThe capital Tunis represents the largest urban agglomeration with 2.4 million inhabitants and is four times larger than the second biggest agglomeration Sousse.

As the population increases or densifies, wards are either reclassified or sub-divided to create new ones.\\nThis managed approach to urbanisation is also reflected in the evolution of the country's urban agglomerations, which are planned to anticipate growth and eventually transform from small to medium and from medium to large agglomerations. Dar es Salam stands out as the largest urban agglomeration with 5.3 million inhabitants in 2015. Tanzania counts four other agglomerations with more than 500 000 inhabitants (Arusha, Mwanza, Zanzibar and Mbeya).

It has since undergone a remarkable transformation. In the five years since 2010, Uganda's level of urbanisation more than doubled from 18.3% to 39.5% in 2015. At the same time, the primacy of the capital Kampala was eclipsed: in 2010, Kampala was still 16 times larger than the second biggest agglomeration but by 2015, it was barely twice as populous as the second-ranking agglomeration Mbale.\\nKampala still accounts for more than one-quarter of the total urban population, but medium-sized agglomerations are increasingly important in terms of urban population distribution. In 2015, they accounted for 41% of the total urban population. Nonetheless, more than half of all agglomerations in Uganda (83 out of 125) are smaller ones with populations between 10 000 and 50 000 inhabitants.\\nThis growth in urbanisation is largely driven by the increasing density of rural areas (i.e. in-situ urbanisation), with many agglomerations having sprung up around the major road networks. Some extend in linear form and merge with other smaller agglomerations. These newer agglomerations are generally characterised by a relatively low population density and many lack a distinctly urban character.\\nAmongst the largest agglomerations are a few whose urban network expands beyond the border. This is the case for the agglomerations of Mbale and Busia, which extend into Kenya, and Kabale on the Rwandan border. The southern part of the country has seen the largest growth in urban population. At the current pace, the area around Lake Victoria could see the emergence of a megapolis with more than 10 million people in the coming decades.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":48,\r\n    \"title\":\"South Africa\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 16.458028493020869,-46.9784114781806],[38.0028518078575, -22.126605626189018 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 54646556  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 38200751  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.70  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 502  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.39  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  17.20  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3098.31  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 12329.54  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.010  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[12.37140606,15.69843333,18.6323381,24.00231111,35.89594,43.9616125,50.98747879,54.539451]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[4.082564,5.651436,7.825582,10.80104,14.358376,24.618503,33.651736,38.200751]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[8.288842061,10.04699733,10.8067561,13.20127111,21.537564,19.3431095,17.33574279,16.3387]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.024103205,0.017281401,0.02564855,0.04106831,0.020476078,0.014936783,0.013559958]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.033052948,0.033084352,0.032749261,0.028878222,0.055396457,0.031750251,0.025682358]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.019422564,0.007316404,0.020215788,0.050166313,-0.010688697,-0.010896778,-0.011776883]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"At 70%, the Republic of South Africa has the sixth highest level of urbanisation in Africa. Africapolis counts a total of 502 urban agglomerations in South Africa ??the fourth highest figure in Africa. In 2015, almost half of all urban dwellers lived in cities with more than 500 000 inhabitants. The agglomeration of Johannesburg, which includes Pretoria, the Witwatersrand, Soshanguwe and multiple smaller agglomerations, accounts for 8.3 million inhabitants, representing one-fifth of the total urban population of South Africa.\\nThe average urban population density however is relatively low at 3 102 per km2, which is related to the relatively vast spread of some urban agglomerations. Historically, many of the early cities of South Africa were designed as ?쐅arden cities?? i.e. cities with a lot of open green spaces. The built environment of these cities is relatively spread out, intercut with areas without any construction. Given the morphological approach of Africapolis, this means that some cities appear as multiple agglomerations in the Africapolis database.\\nMajor changes in the pattern of urbanisation become visible after 1990, i.e. during the end of Apartheid. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of urban agglomerations increases from 171 to 462, with much of that growth stemming from smaller agglomerations with fewer than 50 000 inhabitants. The urban population grows at a rate of 5.4% (compared to 2.9% during the previous decade) whereas the rural population starts to experience a decline, a trend that continued until 2015.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":49,\r\n    \"title\":\"Zambia\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 22.000791365266281,-18.0779855031847],[33.6850993233638, -8.222967862143477 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 15474000  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 6877737  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.44  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 80  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.52  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  56.00  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3180.00  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 2162.81  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.003  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[2.354615385,3.213289474,4.176818519,5.702630556,7.491142424,10.13829412,13.1140175,15.499193]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.3061,0.610525,1.127741,2.052947,2.472077,3.44702,5.245607,6.877737]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[2.048515385,2.602764474,3.049077519,3.649683556,5.019065424,6.691274118,7.8684105,8.621456]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.031580175,0.02657238,0.031627625,0.027654863,0.030722326,0.02607023,0.033986017]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.07147986,0.063287215,0.061736718,0.018751886,0.033803935,0.042882055,0.055674334]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.024234886,0.015952398,0.018142753,0.032373302,0.029173503,0.016337193,0.018447676]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Zambia is a sparsely populated country with an average of 21 inhabitants per km2. Unlike most African countries, Zambia's urban profile is characterised by a marked absence of smaller agglomerations. The capital Lusaka holds more than one-third of all urban dwellers and is six times larger than the second biggest city Kitwe.\\nThe stretch of land that forms the northwestern border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo - known as the Copperbelt - has been the location of several larger agglomerations, such as Chingola, Kitwe and Ndola, whose existence is linked to copper mining. However, fluctuations in copper prices have meant that many of these agglomerations are in decline. This stands in contrast with the growth of medium-sized urban agglomerations (between 50 000 and 500 000 inhabitants) whose total population has increased from 1.6 million in 2000 to 2.1 million in 2015.\\nA feature of Zambian urbanisation is the existence of spontaneous settlements on the periphery of cities that are unrecognised in official statistics. As a result, official urbanisation statistics divert largely from the findings of Africapolis. Since only the populations living within the official boundaries of cities are counted, official statistics underestimate the true extent of urbanisation and, in some cases, ignore entire urban agglomerations that have sprung up spontaneously through the merger of smaller localities without any attachment to an official city. This is for instance the case of several agglomerations along the eastern side of Lake Mweru in northern Zambia. Some of these agglomerations, like Mwatishi and Nchelenge, stretch out over a length of more than 20 kilometres, occasionally reaching population densities above 3 000 inhabitants per km2.\"\r\n                           }\r\n               ]\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"id\":50,\r\n    \"title\":\"Zimbabwe\",\r\n      \"map\":{\r\n           \"geo\": {\r\n                   \"fitBounds\": {\r\n                         \"bound\": [[[ 25.23634621629985,-22.4177288504699],[33.0588711492188, -15.611514198538828 ]]],\r\n                                }\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n      ,\"keyFigures\":[\r\n            { \"id\": 1, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Total population\", \"value\": 13943242  },\r\n            { \"id\": 2, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Urban population\", \"value\": 4800985  },\r\n            { \"id\": 3, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Level of urbanisation\", \"value\":  0.34  },\r\n            { \"id\": 4, \"type\": \"number\", \"title\": \"Number of agglomerations\", \"value\": 53  },\r\n            { \"id\": 5, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Metropolitan population\", \"value\":  0.61  },\r\n            { \"id\": 6, \"type\": \"distance\", \"title\": \"Avg distance between agglomerations\", \"value\":  34.00  },\r\n            { \"id\": 7, \"type\": \"areaPer\", \"title\": \"Average urban density\", \"value\": 3250.76  },\r\n            { \"id\": 8, \"type\": \"area\", \"title\": \"Urban area\", \"value\": 1476.88  },\r\n            { \"id\": 9, \"type\": \"percentage\", \"title\": \"Urban area / total area\", \"value\":  0.004  }\r\n                         ],\r\n           \"data\": {\r\n                             \"totalPop\":[2.250094444,3.356184615,5.136694118,7.100019048,9.787180769,11.30927,12.69246364,14.120544]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPop\":[0.405017,0.872608,0.873238,1.491004,2.544667,3.392781,4.188513,4.800985]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPop\":[1.845077444,2.483576615,4.263456118,5.609015048,7.242513769,7.916489,8.503950636,9.319559]\r\n                             ,\"totalPopGrowth\":[0.040793352,0.043479175,0.032898343,0.032618282,0.014559908,0.011605392,0.021553462]\r\n                             ,\"urbanPopGrowth\":[0.079778296,7.21739E-05,0.05495666,0.054909528,0.029182723,0.021293115,0.027670988]\r\n                             ,\"ruralPopGrowth\":[0.030163827,0.055524756,0.027809153,0.025888762,0.008937649,0.007183986,0.018485678]\r\n                 },\r\n      \"list\": [\r\n                           {\r\n                             \"type\":\"text\",\r\n                             \"item\":\"Zimbabwe's level of urbanisation has only progressed slowly and is one of the lowest in Africa at 33%.

They account for only 16% of the urban population and unlike other African countries, Zimbabwe has not seen a significant growth in their number over the past two decades.
